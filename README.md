## Accessible patterns and components built with [Bourbon] and [Bitters]

Refills are a starting point for interactive patterns and components that are
accessible and semantic. If you're using the Bourbon suite, we encourage you to
copy and paste them into your project's codebase to build from.

Each are designed to:

- Emphasize accessibility
- Be grid agnostic
- Have minimal visual opinion, so there is little to overwrite
